Now when we have established the physical fundamentals upon which music is built we can explore two very important components on the middle level of musical abstraction - melody and harmony. Since they are very closely connected we will study them together.

Both melody and harmony deal with tones, each from a rather different point of view. *Melody* studies how tones are distributed in time and how consecutive tones might be connected into "lines". The focus of *harmony* is, on the other hand, on how multiple tones meeting at the same time work together.

	- harmony - multiple tones at once - vertical view

One of the important concepts in melody and harmony is a *collection of tones*, ie. a group of multiple tones that are somehow related.

We will learn much about various forms of tone collections - intervals, scales, chords, etc. - and how they are also related together.
