We have seen that some collections of tones fit well together and nice melodies can be built upon them. In fact we can take more than two tones to sound at once. Such collections of a few tones that usually sound together are called *chords*.

Most practically used chords contain three or four distinct tones (pitch classes), sometimes (eg. in jazz) chord of size five to seven are used. Bigger chords are practically never used since the neighboring tones would inevitably clash into dissonance. Also collections of two or less tones are typically not called chords.

## Chords within the diatonic scale

First we can explore which chords can be made from the tones of the diatonic scale. First from chord of size 3, traditionally called *triads*, then we'll add more tones.

To do this a bit systematically, we can first start by enumerating along the natural ordering of the tones in the scale (scale degrees) - by some fixed step size. Let's say we work in the C diatonic scale.

### 3-tone chords

#### 3-tone chords of step 1

	C D E
	D E F
	E F G
	G A B
	A B C
	B C D

If we try to play the chords we'll hear that thay don't sound much consonantly. The reason is that their harmonics are not aligned and they produce quite a lot of beating.

Also in practice such chords are not used very much.

#### 3-tone chords of step 2

	C E G  (C)
	D F A  (Dm)
	E G B  (Em)
	F A C  (F)
	G B D  (G)
	A C E  (Am)
	B D F  (Bdim, B b5)

	TODO: illustration

Bingo! By walking over the scale degrees with the step of two (ie. skipping every other degree) we get quite consonantly and familiarly sounding chords. Indeed, these chords are used in practice A LOT and they form the backbone of the Western music!

In the parentheses we can see the traditional names of those chords.

#### 3-tone chords of step 3

	C F B (C4M7-5, F5 b5, Bdim-3 b9)
	D G C (C2, G4, D47-5)
	E A D (D2, A4, E47-5)
	F B E (F4M7-5, B5 b5, Edim-3 b9)
	G C F (F2, C4, G47-5)
	A D G (G2, D4, A47-5)
	B E A (A2, E4, B47-5)

#### 3-tone chords of other steps

Walking the scale by steps 4, 5, 6 is the same as for steps 3, 2, 1 in the opposite direction. Thus we get the chords containing the same tones. Step 0 is trivial as we get always just one tone.

### 4-tone chords

### Chords with more tones

#### 5-tone chords

#### 6-tone chords

#### 7-tone chords

## Other chords

- diminished
- augmented
- altered


- triads, tetrachords, ...
- traditional notation
	- roman numeral - root as the scale degree
	- type of the chord
	- naming: degree steps on a diatonic scale based at the chord root
- chord structure
	- 1 3 5 7 2 4 6, ...
- diatonic scale can be decomposed into triad + tetrachord (7 possibilities)
- stability vs. instability
	- generally used chords
	- rarely used chords
	- how the number of pitch classes in the chord affect the stability
		- why the number of pitch classes in a chord is rather low
	- diagram of overtones in a chord
	- some chords played without fifth for better clarity (eg. in jazz)
- chord as:
	- ordered set of pitch classes
	- an collection of actual pitches
		- voicings, inversions
- identities between chords
	- multiple names depending on what's the root
- structure of the diatonic scale
- chords
	- three major triads, three minor ones, one diminied triad
	- cadence
		- relation between triads of the same type
			- tonic, subdominant, dominant
		- relation between triads across the type (parallel major-minor)
	- relation to traditional major and minor keys
