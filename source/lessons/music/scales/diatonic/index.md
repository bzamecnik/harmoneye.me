- [pentatonic scale](/blog/2012/pentatonics-and-major-scale/)
	- complement and also subset
- notation via the scale degrees
- properties - its unique position among other scales
	- generated by fifths (from the tone fifth below the root, eg. from F in C diatonic scale)
		- no gaps in the cirlce-of-fifths diagram
		- 7 is one of the generators of Z12
	- maximally even
		- highest bit-set index of all canonic 7-tone sets
		- highest entropy
	- its interval spectrum has unique interval count (this is unique among all 7-tone sets)
	- it contains 6x fifth interval (maximum of all 7-tone sets)
		- most tones sound harmonically
- relation to just intonation derived from overtones
- transposition - 12 diatonic scales
- another derivation: circle of fifths
- structure of the chromatic scale
	- two complementary pentatonics
	- intersection at two tones
	- two mirror diatonic scales
	- diatonic scale + complementary pentatonic scale
- [scale circle diagram](/blog/2013/scale-based-pitch-class-circle/)
- traditional notation - accidentals
	- stateful nature of the notation
	- sharps, flats
	- enharmonic equivalence - given 12TET
	- double accidentals - total hell
