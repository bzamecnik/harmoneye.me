What is music? Quite a broad question. One of the answers might be that:

> Music is a language that people use to share emotions via sound.

## Tools and art

Music comprises of many aspects and in these lessons we'll try to learn some of them. Roughly one part of music is technical - the various tools that support particular emotions. The other one is artistic - the human element that makes music interesting using these tools.

It is similar to other fields. Eg. if you paint pictures you have a stack of tools and techniques how to paint - brushes, colors, composition, etc. But it is up to you how to combine them to work well together to communicate your message - an idea or emotion.

If you cook dishes you have many possibilities which ingredients to choose and how to process and mix them. But it is up to you to make such a mix that tastes great.

If you write novels you use the language tools like words, sentences, style, etc. but it is up to you to communicate a meaningful story and balance the moments of tension and release so that the reader wants to read the book till the end.

If you write software you have a lot of tools too - from mathematical theory, through various languages and libraries, to design patterns and best practices. But it is up to you to balance all the aspects to come up with a program that does what you want, is elegant and flexible for futher evolving.

It is a universal pattern. You have the tools and how to use them to get a meaningful and beautiful result is up to you.

## How learn music?

It seems a bit hard but is not that much. The process of learning something is usually not that you have a blank paper and try to draw an amazing thing from nothing.

Typically you surround you with it - in this case music. Listen. A lot. Try to experiment on your own. Play with it. Learn from the others. What they do? How to they do that? Why? Start to analyze. Look for patterns. Start to see the connections. Practice what you have discovered. Gradually stop thinging about the tools and start telling you stories, your emotions.

This is the general learning process.

## Music theory

While you can perform music without explicitly knowing how it works - if you are talented you can get much further if you know your tools and are able to use them properly. Since ages many smart people were trying to find out what are the tools and how to use them. And this knowledge resulting from analyzing the music is called *music theory*.

It these lessons we will focus right on music theory, ie. the principles behind music, not on the actual making of music or putting emotions and stories into this medium.
