## What is music?

Quite a broad question. One of the answers might be that:

> Music is a language that people use to share emotions via sound.

### Tools and art

Music comprises of many aspects and in these lessons we'll try to learn some of them. Roughly one part of music is technical - the various tools that support particular emotions. The other one is artistic - the human element that makes music interesting using these tools.

It is similar to many other fields. For example if you paint pictures you have a stack of tools and techniques how to paint - brushes, colors, composition, etc. But it is up to you how to combine them to work well together to communicate your message - an idea or emotion.

If you cook dishes you have many possibilities which ingredients to choose and how to process and mix them. But it is up to you to make such a mix that tastes great.

If you write novels you use the language tools like words, sentences, style, etc. but it is up to you to communicate a meaningful story and balance the moments of tension and release so that the reader wants to read the book till the end.

If you write software you have a lot of tools too - from mathematical theory, through various languages and libraries, to design patterns and best practices. But it is up to you to balance all the aspects to come up with a program that does what you want, is elegant and flexible for futher evolving.

It is a universal pattern. You have the tools and how to use them to get a meaningful and beautiful result is up to you.

### Components of music

Many aspects of music can be studied. Here a diagram that shows the important ones roughly laid out in two dimensions.

They are grouped in several layers from low level aspects up to the high level ones or similarly local and global (affecting a small piece or the whole song).

Alse they are grouped according to how they are related to time (where something occurs in the song) or frequency (does it sound high or low).

## How learn music?

It seems a bit hard but is not that much. The process of learning something is usually not that you have a blank paper and try to draw an amazing thing from nothing.

Typically you surround you with it - in this case music. Listen. A lot. Try to experiment on your own. Play with it. Learn from the others. What they do? How to they do that? Why? Start to analyze. Look for patterns. Start to see the connections. Practice what you have discovered. Gradually stop thinging about the tools and start telling you stories, your emotions.

This is the general learning process.

## Music theory? Why care about it?

While you can perform music without explicitly knowing how it works - if you are talented you can get much further if you know your tools and are able to use them properly. Since ages many smart people were trying to find out what are the tools and how to use them. And this knowledge resulting from analyzing the music is called *music theory*. Generally it is useful to learn from our predecessors and stand on the shoulders of giants. Instead of always reinventing wheel we can save some time for actually creating something new.

## These lessons

It these lessons we will focus right on music theory, ie. the principles behind music, not on the actual making of music or putting emotions and stories into this medium.

Probably a majority of music theory textbooks start with notation. On the other hand we will start with the low-level physical principles as they can later grealy help us better understand what is really going on in music on higher levels.

The lessons will be mostly focused on harmony and tuning rather than the other aspects. You will learn also something about the traditional notation and how to translate the concepts. Care will be taken to keep the terminology consistent with the rest of the world.
