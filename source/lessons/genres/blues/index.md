- blues intonation
	- based on just intonation rather than equal temperament
	- b3, b5, b7 - overtones of the root tone
- modulation among three "keys" (not based on the diatonic scale)
	- similar concept to the cadence
- blues chords
	- dominant - why?
- ambivalence between major and minor sound
- traditional blues form - 12-bar blues
