Before we start playing with music we dig a bit deeper into the lower-level of musical abstraction - the physical principles of sound - how it its created, how it behaves and how it is perceived by humans. Thanks to understanding the foundations some problems in the higher levels will be much clearer to understand.

## Let's ask the fundamental questions

Imagine this situation: *Alice sings a tone. Bob listens to this sound. After a breif moment of silence he claps his hands in an applause.*

Very simple, huh? However, we might ask several questions:

- what is sound?
- what is silence?
- what is a tone?
- what is a handclap? how it differs from a tone?
- how Alice created the tone?
- how it gets into Bob's ears?
- how Bob hears the music via his ears?

Let's try to figure out the answers.
