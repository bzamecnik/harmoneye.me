- a mid-local higher-level property of a song
- a point of stability ("center of gravity")
	- identified by the root of a diatonic scale
	- allows to assign other tones a distance the root
	- allows to classify tones as within or outside the key
	- the collection of tones within the key is typically a diatonic scale
		- since the distance measure is based on circle of fifths
	- established by the tones in the recent history
- derived from the harmonic series
- traditional theory distinguishes between major and minor keys
	- this is based on the fact that there are two cadences within the diatonic scale
	- since the major cadence is based on the 1st mode and the minor cadence on the 6th mode of the same diatonic scale it is possible to use root of this single diatonic scale as the key name
- sometimes there's no definite key
	- instability
	- ambiguity between several keys
	- or the key is totally undefined
