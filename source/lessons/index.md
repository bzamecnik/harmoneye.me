## Contents

The lessons are going to be written continuously. Imagene a living lean published book. The following is the expected outline of the topics.

Also I've imported some older blog posts - they contain some very interesting stuff but need to be rewritten for better clarity and incorporated into the lessons.

Do you have any question? Feel free to [write me](/contact/). Want to be notified when there will be new lessons? You can subscribe to the newsletter.

### [Introduction](introduction.html)
- What is music?
	- tools and art
	- components of music
- How to learn music?
- Music theory? Why care about it?
- These lessons

- physical principles
	- sound and silence
		- waves of sound pressure
	- time, frequency, intensity
	- percussive sounds vs. harmonic tones - concentration of energy in time/frequency
		- percussive sounds - peaks in time, spread in frequency
		- harmonic sounds - peaks in frequency, spread in time
	- overtones
		- timbre
	- interaction of multiple tones
		- consonance vs. dissonance
	- producing sound - instruments
	- perceiving sound - ears
		- log-frequency, log-intensity perception
	- pitch
	- tuning
		- which tones to use together?
		- just intonation
			- based on the physics - derived from overtones
			- suitable for instruments with continuous pitch - like voice
		- 12-tone equal temperament
			- compromise tuning for intruments with fixed pitches
			- allows changing keys easily
			- good mathematical properties - matches the Z12 group
			- suitable for instruments with fixed pitch
		- comparison of JI and 12TET
		- other tuning systems
		- problems with tuning
			- inharmonicity
				- overtones not ideal or moving in time
- tones
	- frequency, tone, pitch
	- octave equivalence
		- based on matching overtones
	- pitch class
	- melody
	- rhythm
	- transposition
	- piano keyboard diagram
	- traditional notation - note staff
- intervals - dyads
	- difference between two pitches
	- octave inversion, eg. 5 ~ 7 = 12 - 5
	- octave equivalence (eg. modulo 12)
	- stability vs. instability
- scales, pitch class sets
	- collections of tones
	- plain sets
	- sets with natural ordering
		- no root - circular
		- root - linear
- chromatic scale
	- based on the 12TET
	- 12 pitch class sets
	- can be modelled via the Z12 group
	- traditional notation
	- pitch class circle diagram
		- coloring
- diatonic scale
	- [pentatonic scale](/blog/2012/pentatonics-and-major-scale/)
		- complement and also subset
	- notation via the scale degrees
	- tranditional notation - accidentals
		- stateful nature of the notation
		- sharps, flats
		- enharmonic equivalence - given 12TET
		- double accidentals - total hell
	- properties
	- relation to just intonation derived from overtones
	- its unique position among other scales
	- transposiion - 12 diatonic scales
	- another derivation: circle of fifths
	- structure of the chromatic scale
		- two complementar pentatonics
		- intersection at two tones
		- two mirror diatonic scales
		- diatonic scale + complementar pentatonic scale
	- [scale circle diagram](/blog/2013/scale-based-pitch-class-circle/)
- chords
	- beyond two tones at once
	- chords derived from the diatonic scale
	- triads, tetrachords, ...
	- traditional notation
		- roman numeral - root as the scale degree
		- type of the chord
	- chord structure
		- 1 3 5 7 2 4 6, ...
	- stability vs. instability
		- generally used chords
		- rarely used chords
		- how the number of pitch classes in the chord affect the stability
			- why the number of pitch classes in a chord is rather low
	- chord as:
		- ordered set of pitch classes
		- an collection of actual pitches
			- voicings, inversions
	- identities between chords
		- multiple names depending on what's the root
- key
	- a mid-local property of a song
	- a point of stability - typically a diatonic scale
	- named by the diatonic scale root
	- traditional theory distinguish between major and minor keys
		- since the natural minor scale is just a mode of diatonic scale we'll not distinguish them
	- sometimes there's no definite key
		- instability
		- ambiguity between several keys
		- or the key is totally undefined
- structure of the diatonic scale
	- three major triads, three minor ones, one diminied triad
	- cadence - pendulum harmony
		- relation between triads of the same type
			- tonic, subdominant, dominant
		- relation between triads across the type (parallel major-minor)
	- relation to traditional major minor keys
- harmony - using chords
	- chord progressions
- modes - changing the root of an ordered scale
- other scales
	- harmonic minor
		- derivation
	- melodic minor
	- symmetric scales
- [general way of generating chords from any scale](/blog/2012/generating-chords-the-math-behind/)
- relations among keys
	- mirror-conjugated diatonic scales
		- tritone substitution
		- altered dominant
		- neapolitan chords
		- tristan chord
- modulation between keys
	- various methods
	- relative major-minor
	- using diminished chords
		- what's similar between latin bossa and J.S.Bach?
	- augmented chords
- blues
	- blues intonation
		- based on just intonation rather than equal temperament
		- b3, b5, b7 - overtones of the root tone
	- modulation among three "keys" (not based on the diatonic scale)
		- similar concept to the cadence
	- blues chords
		- dominant - why?
	- ambivalence between major and minor sound
	- traditional blues form - 12-bar blues
