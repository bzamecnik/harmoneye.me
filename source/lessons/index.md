## Contents

The lessons are going to be written continuously. Imagine a living lean published book. The following is the expected outline of the topics.

Also I've imported some older blog posts - they contain some very interesting stuff but need to be rewritten for better clarity and incorporated into the lessons.

The lessons will be organized so that you can read them from beginning to end. However you can skip some more advanced parts and return to them later or use whatever order you want.

Do you have any question? Feel free to [write me](/contact/). Want to be notified when there will be new lessons? You can subscribe to the newsletter.

### [Introduction](introduction.html)
- What is music?
	- tools and art
	- components of music
- How to learn music?
- Music theory? Why care about it?
- Structure of these lessons

### Melody, harmony and beyond - how does music work?

- [Melody and harmony](melody-and-harmony.html) - the dance of tones

- the [12-tone scale](scales/12-tone/) - the musical canvas
	- 12-tone scale given - the most commonly used collection of tone in Western music
	- we'll try to find some structure in it
	- assume pitch circularity, octave equivalence, equal temperament
	- analogy with the clock
	- relative order between elements
		- the order is not absolute without a reference
			- linear vs. circular ordering
	- intervals
	- interval classes
	- major pentatonic (eg. C)
		- some melodies from it
		- intervals
		- chords it contains: I, VIm, V2, V4, VI4, II2, II4
		- each tone has its fifth (except for E)
		- each tone has its fourth (except for C)
	- transposition to near pentatonics (down to F, up to G)
		- additional tones - B, F
		- the rest is shared
	- diatonic scale
		- contains the three pentatonics (F, C, G)
		- contains all interval classes
			- two-tone "chords" - intervals
		- the chords from diatonic scale
			- three-tone chords (step 2)
				- C, F, G
				- Am, Dm, Em
				- B b5
				- the pendulum (cadence) relationship
				- relationship between C-Am, F-Dm, G-Em
				- major and minor key
			- four-tone chords
			- the complementary relationshop between triad and tetrachords
			- other chords
				- step 3 - quartal chords
			- larger chords
		- mirror scale
			- the complement is Gb pentatonic
			- intersection of C diatonic with Gb diatonic are B, F
		- modes - starting the scale at different degree

- [Tones](tones/) - single tones
- [Intervals](intervals/) - two tones
- [Scales](scales/) - multiple tones
	- [12-tone scale](scales/12-tone/) - the musical canvas
	- [Pentatonic scale](scales/pentatonic/) - be a star
	- [Diatonic scale](scales/diatonic/) - the holy grail of music
	- [Modes](scales/modes/) - walking around the scale
- [Chords](chords/) - just enough tones for a moment
- [Keys](keys/) - higher-level points of stability
- [Chord progressions](chords/progressions/) - movement among chords
- [Other scales](scales/beyond-diatonic.html) - passion beyond diatonic scale
- [Modulation](keys/modulation/) - movement among keys

- [Overtones](physics/overtones.html) - color inside a tone
- [Interaction of sounds](physics/interaction-of-sounds.html) - tones on a rendez-vous
- [Producing sound](physics/producing-sound.html) - loughing out loud
- [Perceiving sound](physics/perceiving-sound.html) - beating the eardrums
- [Tuning](physics/tuning/) - bring more tuna
