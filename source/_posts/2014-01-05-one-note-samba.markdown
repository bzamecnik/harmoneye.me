Let us dig into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Note_Samba">One Note Samba</a>, an early bossa nova song by A.C.Jobim.

<pre>(1)
           Dbm9          C9            Bm7,4       Bb(b5)
|: This is just a little samba built upon a single note.
      Dbm9               C9             Bm7,4             Bb(b5)
Other notes are bound to follow but the root is still the note.
         Ebm9           Ab7(#5)(b9)        Dbmaj7              Dbm
Now this new one is the consequence of the one we've just been through
       Dbm9            C9          Bm7,4          Bb(b5)
as I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you. :|

(chorus)
Ebm                            Ab7
There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk and just say
Dbmaj7
nothing, or nearly nothing.
Dbm                            Gb7
I have used up all the scale I know and at the end I've come to
Bmaj7
nothing, or nearly nothing.

(2)
        Dbm9            C9              Bm7,4             Bb(b5)
|: So I come back to my first note as I must come back to you.
       Dbm9           C9               Bm7,4           Bb(b5)
I will pour into that one note all the love I feel for you.
   Ebm9              Ab7(#5)(b9)         Dbmaj7          Dbm
Anyone who wants the whole show: re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do;
        Dbm9              C9              Bm7,4             Bb(b5)
he will find himself with no show. Better play the note you know. :|

(R)
(2) and the last two lines 2x</pre>
The song's main key is B and there are several modulations two half-tone upÂ into the key of Db.
