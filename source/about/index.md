## What is there?

Basically a collection of [music theory lessons](../lessons/) and a [blog](../blog/).

## Who writes it and why?

Hi! My name is [Bohumír Zámečník](http://zamecnik.me) and I love music. Since being a child music have always filled me with amazement and couriosity. Why this sounds so strangly beautiful?

Although I attended a music school very shortly, after years I came back to learning music myself. Since high school I enjoy singing with the [Corale](http://corale.cz) chord (10+ years), ocassionally play guitar or other intruments with friends or at home. During 2013 I decided to take singing lessons - and I was amazed.

Nevertheless, I am extremely curious about music theory. How does it work? Why it is able to express the emotions so well. Being a Computer Science graduate I love to express the various tools present in music using in terms of mathematics. Well, simply said, there's certain amazing structure present in music which allows it to be so beautiful. And it would exist in mathematics even if there was no music at all. And it's interesting to discover it.

Also being very visually-based person and a programmer (actually I graduated in Computer Graphics) one of the software I'm developing is aimed to help you see what's going in the harmony of a song. Like if you had absolute pitch - inside your eyes. It's called [HarmonEye](http://harmoneye.com/), it is free and it currently runs on Android and Mac OS X.

I know that during the ages very much has been written about music theory and I can't say that I know everything. I just like to share what I've learnt the way I wish I learn it and also some interesting insights. And I hope it's interesting for someone. The best award would be if you learn how to use the musical tools so well to express your own emotions.

If you'd like this site feel free to share it with your friends and/or [drop me a few words](../contact/).

Enjoy!
