    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png">http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png</a>" width="200"></p>

<p>In this article I&rsquo;d like to introduce a new way visualizing chords generated from some particular scale. It is a generalization of the classic pitch class circle but in contrast it captures the chord progressions very clearly. It is a powerful tool able to visualize the natural feeling of distance between chords by their similarity and the two directions of motion. Besides the description there is a plenty of animated examples.</p></p>

<h2>Linear vs. circular visualization</h2>

<p>On the piano the pitches are represented by keys which are arranged linearly. The white keys are the pitches from the C diatonic (C major) scale are the black keys are their complement to the full chromatic scale. The patterns of keys are repeated for each octave. The pitches on the same position in the pattern but without regard to the octave sound similar and can be treated as equal thus creating a pitch class. In the common western music the octave consists of 12 pitch class.</p>




<p><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-linear-step1-c-diatonic-scale.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-c-diatonic-scale.png" /></p>


<h3>The C diatonic scale visualized in linear and circular way.</h3>

<p>The linear arrangement is quite illustrative (eg. compared to some wind instruments) but does not capture the fact that the pitch classes form a circular group. In simple words when a pitch class is transposed it wraps around. Thus when the octave is not important a circular visualizaiton for pitch classes is more illustrative than linear. Eg. when transpositions of a chord are visualized linearly they form several different patterns beacause the "wrapping" is not continuous. On the other hand transposing chords in a pitch class circle amounts just to a rotation with the "shape" being preserved.</p>

<p><em>Transpositions of a major triad, 12-tone circle. It rotates.</em></p>




<p>If we take a scale and make some melody or chords, we use a subset of the whole set of 12 pitch classes. When we generate a set of chords from a scale, eg. by stepping over the scale degrees as described in the previous article <a href="http://harmoneye.me/blog/2012/generating-chords-the-math-behind/">Generating Chords - The Math Behind</a>, they are visualized by several, generally different, shapes. Then in a usual chord progression the subsequent chords often share some pitch classes, while the others are changed. The result is the visualization is still not as illustrative as it can be.</p>




<p class="slider"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-c-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-dm-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-em-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-f-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-g-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-am-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/12scale-step1-3-bmb5-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>Diatonic triads, 12-tone circle</em></p>


<h2>Scale-based circular visualization</h2>

<p>What can we do with it? In case the song or its part is based just on some scale and does not contain alterations (using pitch classes outside the scale) what about restricting the visualization just to the pitch classes from that scale? Eg. for the diatonic scale we can make a circle of just 7 instead of 12 elements. The ordering can be preserved. Now the chords of the same size generated from the scale by making uniform steps over the scale degrees have all the same shape! That's because we eliminated the pitch classes outside the scale.</p>




<p class="slider"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-c-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-dm-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-em-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-f-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-g-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-am-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-3-bmb5-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>Diatonic triads, 7-tone circle, step 1</em></p>




<p class="slider"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-cmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-dm7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-em7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-fmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-g7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-am7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step1-4-bm7b5-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>Diatonic tetrachords, 7-tone circle, step 1</em></p>


<h2>Reordered scale-based circular visualization</h2>

<p>Still, there is something to be improved. When you play music or listen to it you may notice that the chords move back and forth or follow a longer line. For sure you may distinguish whether the movement goes in one direction or the other. You may also feel whether two chords are close or further apart. However, in the present visualization we do not see these two aspects well.</p>




<p>The solution is to follow the way the chords were generated. Eg. in the diatonic scale the common usable chords are generated with step 2 which means that we take every second scale degree. Thus we might reorder the pitch classes in the set the same way. Then the pitch classes making the chord get grouped together. A triad makes an arc of three pitch classes, a tetrachord makes an arc of size four and so on.</p>

<p><em>Diatonic triads, 7-tone circle, step 2. Without "holes". Subsequent chords share no tones.</em></p>




<p class="slider"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-dm7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-em7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-fmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-g7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-am7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-bm7b5-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>Diatonic tetrachords, 7-tone circle, step 2. Subsequent chords share one tone.</em></p>


<h2>Examples &ndash; common chord progressions</h2>

<p>How the chords are far apart directly correlates with the number of pitch classes they share. Also there are two directions of movement on the perimeter of the circle. Just as we intuitively feel. A chord's quality can be also expressed by the angle of its "center of gravity". Note that it is different from the chord's root.</p>


<h3>I IV I V progression</h3>

<p class="slider infinite"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-c-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-f-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-c-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-g-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>A common country or folk progression: C, F, C, G. Notice the back-and-forth movement.</em></p>




<p class="slider infinite"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-am-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-dm-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-am-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-em-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>A similar progression using relative minor chords: Am, Dm, Am, Em. Rotated from the previous one by one step counter-clockwise.</em></p>


<h3>II V I progression</h3>

<p>In jazz the absolutely basic progression which is used in many variations is the II-V-I progression. Eg. in the C key it is Dm7 G7 Cmaj7. In fact there is just a movement by fifths upwards. Notice the symmetry on the diagram - the Cmaj7 and Dm7 share just one common tone, while G7 shares two common tones with the other chords.</p>




<p class="slider infinite"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-dm7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-g7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>The II-V-I progression (Dm7 G7 Cmaj7)</em></p>




<p>Again there is a commonly utilized minor variant of the II-V-I progression.</p>




<p class="slider infinite"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-bm7b5-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-em7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-am7-chord.png" /></p>




<p>In practice this progression gets altered a bit. Especially Em7 is altered to E7 to act as a dominant chord in the minor II-V-I progression Bm7b5 E7 Am7. The raised third, Ab, resolves to the A tone in Am7. The other point of view on this is that the chords are generated from the harmonic minor scale instead of the diatonic one.</p>


<h3>Circular progression</h3>

<p>In fact those two progressions are part of a more interesting progression that is also commonly used in practice - Cmaj7 Fmaj7 Bm7b5 Em7 (or altered to E7) Am7 Dm7 G7 Cmaj7. It can be very naturally visualized as an arc moving around in a single direction. Note that the progression ends with the II-V-I progression mentioned before. All subsequent chords share exactly two tones.</p>




<p class="slider infinite"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-fmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-bm7b5-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-em7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-am7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-dm7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-g7-chord.png" /></p>




<p><em>A common jazz progression with a circular movement.</em></p>


<h2>Complements &ndash; upper structure</h2>

<p>When we take a chord its complementary pitch classes make another chord with is farthest apart on the circle. We could take a tetrachord and combine with its complementary triad. What we obtain would be a 13 chord comprising of all the pitch classes in the scale. Such a triad is than called the upper structure.</p>




<p>There's no reason to use this visualization tool for any other scale than the diatonic one. This can be equally useful for chords generated from harmonic minor or even quartal chords generated from the chromatic scale. In fact the widely known circle of fifths is a special case of this for the chromatic scale and step size 7.</p>




<p class="slider"><img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-4-cmaj7-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-3-dm-chord.png" /> <img alt="image" src="http://harmoneye.fairos.cz/music-theory/7scale-step2-diatonic-scale.png" /></p>


<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>Although this visualization is very suitable for chords generated from the same scale the circle is built upon it falls short with alterations, ie. pitch clases from the scale's complement. There is not a straightforward way to add the pitch classes complementary to the selected scale since the pitch classes inside the scale are reordered by scale degrees.</p>


<h2>Final notes</h2>

<p>The illustrations have been created using the free interactive web application <a href="http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/">Music Theory Toolbox</a>, that I'm developing. Currently it only supports the 12-tone circle but I hope I'll extend it soon to the described scale-basic circular visualization. Feel free to play with it and send me your oppinion how it could be improved.</p>

    <id>http://harmoneye.me/blog/2012/pentatonics-and-major-scale</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post we will explore modes, the pentatonic scale and its modes, modes of the major scale, the relationships between pentatonic scale modes and the major scale modes and also with the dorian bebop and chromatic scale.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Pentatonic scales</h2>

<p>Generally, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale">pentatonic scale</a> can be any scale of size five. In practice there are several scales with certain structure that are referred to as the pentatonic scales and which are heavily used in many genres. Two of them are the minor and major pentatonic scale. In the example we use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class">pitch class</a> sequence notation.</p>

<p><code>
minor pentatonic: [0, 3, 5, 7, 10]
major pentatonic: [0, 2, 4, 7, 9]
</code></p>

<p>The major pentatonic scale can be derived from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale">major scale</a> (the ionian mode) by taking away the third and seventh scale degrees.</p>

<p><code>
ionian:           [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]
major pentatonic: [0, 2, 4,    7, 9    ]
</code></p>

<p>Similarly the minor pentatonic scale can be derived from the natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale">minor scale</a> (the aeolian mode) by taking the second and sixth scale degree.</p>

<p><code>
aeolian:          [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
minor pentatonic: [0,    3, 5, 7,    10]
</code></p>

<h2>Modes</h2>

<p>The concept of modes of a scale is quite simple. Multiple scales can be derived from a single scale by changing the root note by cyclic rotation of the pitch class sequence. This can be seen as restricting the permutations of the underlying (unordered) pitch class set using the ordering of the original sequence.</p>

<h3>Modes of the major scale</h3>

<p>See below an example of modes of the major scale. Its modes have traditional names after some Greek tribes.</p>

<p>Modes of the C major scale:</p>

<p><code>
1st mode - ionian:     [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]
2nd mode - dorian:        [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 0]
3rd mode - phrygian:         [4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 0, 2]
4th mode - lydian:              [5, 7, 9, 11, 0, 2, 4]
5th mode - mixolydian:             [7, 9, 11, 0, 2, 4, 5]
6th mode - aeolian:                   [9, 11, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7]
7th mode - locrian:                      [11, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
</code></p>

<h3>The rotation operators</h3>

<p>For clarity we can denote the operation of rotation by two operators: <code>&gt;&gt;</code> for right rotation and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> for left rotation.</p>

<p>```
base_scale &lt;&lt; rotation_steps = derived_mode</p>

<pre><code>             ionian &lt;&lt; 1 = dorian
</code></pre>

<p> [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11] &lt;&lt; 1 = [2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 0]
```</p>

<p>Note that modes can be derived from any scale and also that the number of unique modes for that scale equals to the size of the scale.</p>

<h3>Normalizing the modes</h3>

<p>The reason for dealing with modes stems from the difference in the root note. In practice the root note is the home from which we travel around and where we return back to. Thus each mode sounds quite differently. The quality of each mode can be better seen if we normalize it, ie. transpose it so that the root pitch class is zero.</p>

<p>The derived modes from a scale are indicated by the root note, so that C ionian, D dorian, or G mixylydian belong to the same scale. When we normalize the modes we get C ionian, C dorian, C mixolydian, each derived from a different scale, but having the same root note.</p>

<p>```
Normalized modes of the C major scale:</p>

<p>C ionian:     [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]
C dorian:     [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
C phrygian:   [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
C lydian:     [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11]
C mixolydian: [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
C aeolian:    [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
C locrian:    [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10]
```</p>

<h3>Modes of the major pentatonic scale</h3>

<p>It has been already said that modes can be derived from any scale. So why not to explore the modes of the pentatonic scale? Let us select the major pentatonic as the base scale. There are the modes in the normalized form:</p>

<p>```
Modes of the major pentatonic scale (normalized):</p>

<p>1st mode [0, 2, 4, 7, 9 ] major pentatonic
2nd mode [0, 2, 5, 7, 10]
3rd mode [0, 3, 5, 8, 10]
4th mode [0, 2, 5, 7, 9 ]
5th mode [0, 3, 5, 7, 10] minor pentatonic</p>

<p>major pent. | 0 |   | 2 |   | 4 |   |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |   |
2nd mode    | 0 |   | 2 |   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |   |
3rd mode    | 0 |   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   |   | 8 |   | 10 |   |
4th mode    | 0 |   | 2 |   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |   |
minor pent. | 0 |   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |   |
```</p>

<p>The interesting thing here is that the minor pentatonic scale is just a mode of the major one. In other words they share the same structure and can be derived from each other just by rotation. Formally written <code>major pentatonic &lt;&lt; 4 = minor pentatonic</code>. The relation is also this: k-major pentatonic is related to <code>(k - 3 mod 12)</code>-minor penatonic, eg. the A minor pentatonic can be derived from the C major pentatonic.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is the number of notes that are common between the base scale and its normalized modes:</p>

<p><code>
1st mode | 0 |   | 2 |   | 4 |   |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |  | 5 common
4th mode | 0 |   | 2 |   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |  | 4 common
2nd mode | 0 |   | 2 |   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |  | 3 common
5th mode | 0 |   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |  | 2 common
3rd mode | 0 |   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   |   | 8 |   | 10 |  | 1 common
</code></p>

<h2>Pentatonic scales vs. major scale</h2>

<p>Finally, equipped with the knowledge of modes and pentatonic scales we can explore the relation between the pentatonic scales and and the major scale and its modes.</p>

<p>What happens when we stack two pentatonic scales with different roots, ie. if we make a union of their pitch class sequences (and maintain the order)? Say the offset is 2 half-tones. Let us put them into a diagram and see.</p>

<p><code>
C minor pent.    |_0_|   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |   |
D minor pent.    | 0 |   |_2_|   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |   |
C dorian         |_0_|   | 2 | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 | 10 |   |
</code></p>

<p>Hey! We&rsquo;ve got C dorian! So that when you could play D dorian you can just restrict youself to C and D minor pentatonics and switch between them to make some contrast. Well, if we got the dorian, then we can also obtain the first mode, ie. the major scale itself. Indeed:</p>

<p><code>
D minor pent.  | 0 |   |_2_|   |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |   |    |
E minor pent.  |   |   | 2 |   |_4_|   |   | 7 |   | 9 |   | 11 |
C ionian       |_0_|   | 2 |   | 4 | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |   | 11 |
</code></p>

<p>And what about switching between minor and major pentatonic of the same root? The bluesmen do this quite often with the blues scales (which are just pentatonics with a single additional note). Note that the C major pentatonic is a mode of to the A minor pentatonic, so that it is similar to the previous situation.</p>

<p><code>
C minor pent.    |_0_|   |   | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   |   | 10 |   |
C major pent.    |_0_|   | 2 |   | 4 |   |   | 7 |   | 9 |    |   |
C bebop dorian   |_0_|   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 | 10 |   |
C dorian         | 0 |   | 2 | 3 |   | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 | 10 |   |
</code></p>

<p>We obtained the bebop dorian scale – a dorian scale with added major third. In other words if we switch between the minor and major pentatonic scale of the same root we are in fact still walking within the bebop dorian scale. And right the four-tone chromatic part can serve for some nicely sounding runs.</p>

<h2>Ionian + pentatonic = chromatic</h2>

<p>Another interesting thing is that the complement of the ionian scale form a major pentatonic. Eg. C ionian union Gb major pentatonic gives the chromatic scale (the sequence of all 12 pitch classes). This corresponds to the white and black keys on the piano.</p>

<p><code>
C ionian       |_0_|   | 2 |   | 4 | 5 |   | 7 |   | 9 |    | 11 |
Gb major pent. |   | 1 |   | 3 |   |   |_6_|   | 8 |   | 10 |    |
C chromatic    |_0_| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |

    <id>http://harmoneye.me/blog/2012/generating-chords-the-math-behind</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Musical chords might seem just as random groups of tones. What makes them sound “good” alone or together a in sequence? Are there any rules for creating chords or groups of chords that make harmony? Ever wondered why progressions like <code>IIm7</code> <code>V7</code> <code>Imaj7</code> <code>VIIm7b5</code> <code>III7alt</code> <code>VIm7</code> work so well and contain right those chords? In the following text we will explore the ways some of type simpler chord type can be generated from an ordinary scale and also quite a different approach for generating some familiar chords. We will also see some relation to mathematics.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First, we will state the context and terms used throughout the text. We assume we are working with 12-tone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">equal temperament</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic">enharmonic equivalence</a> and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_equivalence">octave equivalence</a>. The main tool for us will be <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class">pitch classes</a></em> and their <em>sets</em> (ordering does not matter) and sequences (ordering matters). Pitch class sets will be denoted by curly braces, eg. <code>{0, 5, 7, 2}</code>, while pitch class sequences by brackets, eg. <code>[0, 5, 7, 2]</code>.</p>

<p>In practice this means that we are working with 12 half-tones denoted by numbers from 0 to 11. The zero pitch class can be assigned to an arbitrary half-tone and we will for simplicity assign it to C as people are most used to it. The pitch class numbers then correspond to the common notation as follows:</p>

<p><code>
| 0 | 1  | 2 | 3  | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7 | 8  | 9 | 10 | 11 |
| C | Db | D | Eb | E | F | Gb | G | Ab | A | Bb | B  |
| C | C# | D | D# | E | F | F# | G | G# | A | A# | B  |
</code></p>

<p>The equivalence between sharp and flat tones is the enharmonic equivalence and is due to the assumption of equal temperament. When needing to express tone names in common notation we will use just the flat sign to make things clearer. Note that a single pitch class corresponds to pitches in all octaves. Also note that pitch classes are invariant to the tuning of the base frequency (we do not need it when analyzing the structure of chords).</p>

<p>These assumptions and notation will be used also in the subsequent articles except where notes otherwise. So let us finally start with generating some chords!</p>

<h2>Generating chords from a scale</h2>

<p>A chord is nothing more difficult than a sequence of pitch classes. Sometimes when comparing chords the information about the order can be thrown away obtaining just pitch class sets. A trivial chord could just contain one or two pitch classes, eg. [6] or [2, 7]. In practice chords contain three or more pitch classes (in order to be musically interesting) which are played at the same. A scale is also a sequence of pitch classes which are in practice usually not played simultaneously. The notes in the scale are called scale
degrees, eg. the third degree corresponds to the zero-based index 3 – 1 = 2.</p>

<h3>An analysis of the simple II-V-I chord progression</h3>

<p>Let us start with an example of three simple chords Dm7, G7, Cmaj7. Those three chords types played in a sequence form the most widely used chord progression in jazz and related genres. It is called the II-V-I progression. In the following diagram we first see the chords tones in common notation and then in the pitch class notation. The root notes (that are at the first place in the pitch class sequence) are marked with an underline.</p>

<p><code>
Dm7   | C |   |_D_|   |   | F |   |   |   | A |    |    |
G7    |   |   | D |   |   | F |   |_G_|   |   |    | B  |
Cmaj7 |_C_|   |   |   | E |   |   | G |   |   |    | B  |
------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+
IIm7  | 0 |   |_2_|   |   | 5 |   |   |   | 9 |    |    |
V7    |   |   | 2 |   |   | 5 |   |_7_|   |   |    | 11 |
Imaj7 |_0_|   |   |   | 4 |   |   | 7 |   |   |    | 11 |
</code></p>

<p>What can be seen in the diagram? On the first sight we can see that the subsequent chord pairs share some notes while differing in others. However, on the second sight we can see probably a more important thing. What do we get when taking all the notes occurring there? Pitch classes <code>[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]</code>, or in other words notes <code>[C, D, E, F, G, A, B]</code>, make up a scale called the C <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale">major scale</a></em> or the C <em>ionian scale</em>. There are 12 major scales (each starting at a different pitch class) and also the major scale is the most widely used scale type in western music. Note that the scale has 7 elements which is a prime number.</p>

<p>What else can be seen from the diagram? If we look carefully eg. on the Cmaj7 chord we can see it contains pitch classes <code>[0, 4, 7, 11]</code> and the complement to the C major scale is <code>[2, 5, 9]</code>. If we index the scale instead of the set of all pitch classes we get indexes <code>[0, 2, 4, 6]</code> and <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>. In terms of notes it is <code>[C, E, G, B]</code> and <code>[D, F, A]</code>. Similarly for Dm7 the indexes are <code>[1, 3, 5, 0]</code> and <code>[2, 4, 6]</code>, while for G7 it is <code>[5, 7, 2, 4]</code> and <code>[6, 1, 3]</code>. Can you see it already?</p>

<h3>Generating the chords</h3>

<p>If we start traversing the scale (circularly) at a given root note and skip each second element we get the known chords! Formally said, we get chords of length k from a scale <code>S</code> by using the following formula, where <code>|S|</code> is the length of the scale S and <code>mod</code> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modular division operation</a>.</p>

<p><code>
 | s in {0, ..., |S|-1}}
</code></p>

<h4>Triads</h4>

<p>Here is an example of taking just three elements from the scale. We get so called triads. For clearness there are only columns of the scale elements, not all the pitch classes.</p>

<p><code>
C  |_C_|   | E |   | G |   |   |
Dm |   |_D_|   | F |   | A |   |
Em |   |   |_E_|   | G |   | B |
F  | C |   |   |_F_|   | A |   |
G  |   | D |   |   |_G_|   | B |
Am | C |   | E |   |   |_A_|   |
Bm |   | D |   | F |   |   |_B_|
</code></p>

<h4>Tetrachords</h4>

<p>By taking four-element chords from the scale we get tetrachords (we have already seen them in the example at the beginning of the section).</p>

<p><code>
Cmaj7 |_C_|   | E |   | G |   | B |
Dm7   | C |_D_|   | F |   | A |   |
Em7   |   | D |_E_|   | G |   | B |
Fmaj7 | C |   | E |_F_|   | A |   |
G7    |   | D |   | F |_G_|   | B |
Am7   | C |   | E |   | G |_A_|   |
Bm7b5 |   | D |   | F |   | A |_B_|
</code></p>

<h3>Quality of the generated chords</h3>

<p>Let us look at the quality of the tetrachords. Now there are columns for all pitch classes and each row starts at the particular chord’s root note. The first row represents the basic C major scale from which we derived the chords. The second row represents what is the common notation for chords notes – the index to the scale based on the chord’s root note (not the base scale), optionally shifted a half-tone down. The further rows contain pitch classes of each chord arranged so that they start at the root note.</p>

<p><code>
scale   | 0  |   | 2 |   | 4  | 5 |   | 7  |   | 9 |   | 11 |
indexes | 1  |b2 | 2 |b3 | 3  | 4 |b5 | 5  |b6 | 6 |b7 | 7  |
--------+----+---+---+---+----+---+---+----+---+---+---+----+
Cmaj7   | 0  |   |   |   | 4  |   |   | 7  |   |   |   | 11 |
Dm7     | 2  |   |   | 5 |    |   |   | 9  |   |   | 0 |    |
Em7     | 4  |   |   | 7 |    |   |   | 11 |   |   | 2 |    |
Fmaj7   | 5  |   |   |   | 9  |   |   | 0  |   |   |   | 4  |
G7      | 7  |   |   |   | 11 |   |   | 2  |   |   | 5 |    |
Am7     | 9  |   |   | 0 |    |   |   | 4  |   |   | 7 |    |
Bm7b5   | 11 |   |   | 2 |    |   | 5 |    |   |   | 9 |    |
</code></p>

<p>We can clearly see a lot of things. For chords generated from the major scale the second degree is either a major or minor third (index 3 or b3), ie. 3 or 4 half-tones apart from the root note. The third notes in the chord are either fifth or flat fifth (7 or 6 half-tones from the root). The fourth notes in the chords areeither seventh or flat seventh (11 or 10 half-tones from the root). To clearly see the chord quality we can transpose the pitch class sequence of a chord down by the value of the root pitch class. The ~ relation denotes equivalence of the pitch class sequences up to a transposition by a constant.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    chord notes       chord types
</code></pre>

<p>Cmaj7 [0,  4,  7,  11] ~ [0, 4, 7, 11]
Dm7   [2,  5,  9,  0 ] ~ [0, 3, 7, 10]
Em7   [4,  7,  11, 2 ] ~ [0, 3, 7, 10]
Fmaj7 [5,  9,  0,  4 ] ~ [0, 4, 7, 11]
G7    [7,  11, 2,  5 ] ~ [0, 4, 7, 10]
Am7   [9,  0,  4,  7 ] ~ [0, 3, 7, 10]
Bm7b5 [11, 2,  5,  9 ] ~ [0, 3, 6, 10]
```</p>

<p>We can divide the chords generated from the major scale into several categories based on the quality of the various chords:</p>

<p>When taking only the second chord notes into consideration the perfect third leads to major chords, while flat third to minor chord types – <code>{0, 3}</code> vs. <code>{0, 4}</code>.</p>

<p>When taking the second and third chord notes we obtain major, minor and diminished chord types – <code>{0, 4, 7}</code>, <code>{0, 3, 7}</code>, <code>{0, 3, 6}</code>.</p>

<p>When taking the second to fourth chord notes we obtain maj7, m7, dominant 7 and half-diminished m7b5 chord types –<code>{0, 4, 7, 11}</code>, <code>{0, 3, 7, 10}</code>, <code>{0, 4, 7, 10}</code>, <code>{0, 3, 6, 10}</code>.</p>

<h4>Beyond tetrachords</h4>

<p>So far we have only considered chords generated from a scale that contained three or four notes. It is clearly possible to add more notes the same way, we are only limited by the total number of notes in the scale (for the major scale it is seven). Note that all the heptachords are practically equivalent since they contain all the scale notes.</p>

<h4>Pentachords</h4>

<p>Only ninths or flat ninths are added. The chords are denoted in the common notation (without modulo 12).</p>

<p><code>
scale   | 0  |   | 2 |   | 4  | 5 |   | 7  |   | 9 |   | 11 |
indexes | 1  |b2 | 2 |b3 | 3  | 4 |b5 | 5  |b6 | 6 |b7 | 7  |

</code></p>

<h4>Hexachords</h4>

</code></p>

<h4>Heptachords</h4>

<p>Note that all the heptachords generated from the scale of length seven contain exactly the same notes. They only only differ in their interpretation based on the root note. Also note that a heptachord can be viewed as being composed of a tetrachord and a triad on top of it. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_structure_triad">upper structure triad</a>. Eg. the third row from bottom depicts the G13 consisting of a G7 tetrachord and Am triad.</p>

<p><code>

<h4>Notes for the major scale</h4>

<p><strong>Important insight</strong>: In literature [1] the triad is defined as a three-note chord obtained by stacking third or various types. This is true, specifically for the major scale. Nevertheless it is rather a consequence of the stated method for generating chords from a scale, not the method itself!</p>

<h3>Generalization of the method</h3>

<p>So far we skipped the scale indexes by a step of size two. In general we can choose an arbitrary step size t (from 0 to |S| – 1) which lead to a generalized formula for chord generation:</p>

<p><code>
 | s in {0, ..., |S|-1}}
</code></p>

<h4>Considering of the scale size</h4>

<p>The scale size plays quite an important role together with the step size. The major scale has seven elements with is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime number</a> which implies that no matter what step size we select the notes within a chord will not repeat until the chord size is less then equal than the scale size! 7 is comprime with 12.
As an example let us generate a hexachord with step six. From the C major scale we obtain the pitch class sequence <code>[0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11]</code>. If we add a pitch class 6 (Gb) to the scale to increase its size to eight, we obtain the chord <code>[0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]</code> ~ <code>{0, 6}</code>!</p>

<p>Thus to be able to generate quite non-trivial chords the scale size should be prime. For the 12-tone equal temperament pitch classes the choices are: <code>2, 3, 5, 7, 11</code>. Nevertheless, the properties of non-prime-sized scale are also utilized in music and octatonic or hexatonic scales can be seen in practice.</p>

<h3>Generating from other scales than the major scale</h3>

<p>We already known that is is possible to generate chords from scales other than the major scale. As for the modes of the major scale (including the aeolian minor scale) they are structurally equivalent to the major scale and thus we get the same chords only in different order. In order to convince the reader that such a method of generating chords is alright as an example we will generate chords from the two more widely used scales, the harmonic and melodic minor.</p>

<h4>Melodic minor scale</h4>

<p>The C melodic minor scale differs from the C major only by the lowered third degree and can be represented by the pitch class sequence <code>[0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]</code>. The tetrachords generated with step equal to <code>2</code> are the following.</p>

<h2>Generating chords with homogeneous intervals</h2>

<p>There can be quite an amount of different chords and also many equivalent ones, depending of the exact definitions. We have seen a way of generating some commonly used chords from scales by skipping the scale degrees. Now we will present a conceptually similar approach. Instead of skipping the scale degrees to generate chord notes we will skip pitch classes themselves. For the chromatic scale, ie. a scale consisting of an ordered sequence of all 12 pitch classes, there is a one-to-one correspondence between pitch classes and scale degrees. Thus this approach might be seen as an application of the former approach to the chromatic scale.</p>

<p>Having a scale of size 12 the skipping step can be from the range 0 to 11. The chord-generating formula can be simplified a bit. Remember the parameters are: <em>t</em> – the skipping step size, <em>k</em> – the chord size.</p>

<p><code>text
{s + t*i mod 12 | i in {0, ..., k-1}} | s in {0, ..., 11}}
</code></p>

<p>At first, let us generate a chords of size 13 from a single root with different step size:</p>

<p><code>
t  | generated chords
0  | 0 |_0_| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
1  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11|_0_|
2  | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10|_0_| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10| 0 |
3  | 0 | 3 | 6 | 9 |_0_| 3 | 6 | 9 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 0 |
4  | 0 | 4 | 8 |_0_| 4 | 8 | 0 | 4 | 8 | 0 | 4 | 8 | 0 |
5  | 0 | 5 | 10| 3 | 8 | 1 | 6 | 11| 4 | 9 | 2 | 7 |_0_|
6  | 0 | 6 |_0_| 6 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 6 | 0 |
7  | 0 | 7 | 2 | 9 | 4 | 11| 6 | 1 | 8 | 3 | 10| 5 |_0_|
8  | 0 | 8 | 4 |_0_| 8 | 4 | 0 | 8 | 4 | 0 | 8 | 4 | 0 |
9  | 0 | 9 | 6 | 3 |_0_| 9 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 9 | 6 | 3 | 0 |
10 | 0 | 10| 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 |_0_| 10| 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 |
11 | 0 | 11| 10| 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |_0_|
</code></p>

<p>The returns back to the root tone are denoted by underline. Only with steps sizes 1, 5, 7 and 11 all pitch classes are visited. For the others some notes repeat more or less earlier.</p>

<p>It might be quite surprising! Well, in fact, not that much if you know a little about algebra. The structure behind pitch classes is a group isomorphic to Z12, the group of integers modulo 12. Just the elements 1, 5, 7, 11 are its generators. The connection between music theory and mathematics is treated in detail by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music">musical set theory</a>).</p>

<p>So let us explore what kind of chords can be generated with homogeneous intervals – from the trivial ones to the more interesting. For steps 1 or 12 (= 12 – 1) we obtain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_cluster">tone clusters</a> of size at most 12. For step 6 we get just tritone dyads as the cycle length is 12 / 6 = 2.</p>

<p>Steps 3 or 9 (= 12 – 3) give rise to diminished chords of 4 (= 12 / 3) unique elements. Since the intervals between chord notes are homogeneous there are only 3 different pitch class sets corresponding to different diminished chord types. Steps 4 or 8 lead us to augmented chords of just 3 (= 12 / 4) elements. There are 4 types of them.</p>

<p>For steps 2 or 10 are generated chords based on the symmetric hexatonic scale, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secundal">secundal chords</a>. They have at most 6 unique elements and there are 2 different such hexachords.</p>

<h3>Quartal chords</h3>

<p>Finally, steps 5 and 7 lead to very interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartal_and_quintal_harmony">quartal and quintal chords</a>. Since the pitch classes 5 and 7 generate the whole chromatic scale there are 12 unique quartal and quintal types of chords of at most 12 elements. Quartal chords have utilization in various genres of music including jazz and rock. We will provide an example of quartal chords of size four derived from the C chromatic scale:</p>

<p><code>
[0,  5,  10, 3 ]
[1,  6,  11, 4 ]
[2,  7,  0,  5 ]
[3,  8,  1,  6 ]
[4,  9,  2,  7 ]
[5,  10, 3,  8 ]
[6,  11, 4,  9 ]
[7,  0,  5,  10]
[8,  1,  6,  11]
[9,  2,  7,  0 ]
[10, 3,  8,  1 ]
[11, 4,  9,  2 ]
</code></p>

<p>Finally, note that the full chords generated by pitch classes other that the generators lead to subgroups of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group">cyclic group</a> Z12 (corresponding to the chromatic scale), the groups Z6, Z4, Z3, Z2, Z1 (divisors of 12). They correspond the the hexatonic, diminished, augmented symmetric scales, the tritone and a single pitch class.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have presented a mathematical method for generating musical chords – by skipping degrees of a scale or directly the pitch classes by steps of constant size. This way we are able to generate many commonly used chords, eg. in jazz. We presented the chords derived from the major scale and several minor scales and also quartal, augmented and diminished chords. Partial and altered chords were not addressed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s start the blog with with some brief, yet interesting, thoughts. I’ve ever liked the distinct sound of latin or spanish music which is full of passion. Also I’ve wondered what is the key to it. As an example take the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY3F5A9L3V0">Cancion del Mariachi by Los Lobos</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>When we look at the chords of the song we can clearly see (or rather hear) the following:</p>

<p><code>
Em / B7 / B7 / Em
Am / Em / B7 / Em
</code></p>

<p>But what does it mean? The key is the usage of the harmonic minor scale. Simply said, it is a natural minor scale where the flat 7th is risen a half tone to the natural 7th. Or when numbering each half tone in an octave with numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>12</code> (as so called pitch classes) it can be expressed as: <code>[0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11]</code>. I love the expressive visual analogy to a clock. Click on the links below images to show an interactive pitch class set calculator (the screenshots are from an old version of this application, now it’s much nicer).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/categories/music-theory/c-natural-minor-scale.png" alt="C natural minor scale"></p>

<p><a href="http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/?pcs=0,2,3,5,7,8,10">C natural minor scale</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/categories/music-theory/c-harmonic-minor-scale-vs-natural.png" alt="C natural harmonic scale"></p>

<p><a href="http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/?pcs=0,2,3,5,7,8,11">C harmonic minor scale</a> (compared to the natural minor scale)</p>

<p>Given a scale we can generate some chords from it. We can make a stencil and select the 1st, 3rd, 5th tone in the scale (so that there is always a one tone gap between neighbor tones). This is called a <em>triad</em>, eg. <code>[0, 3, 7]</code>. If we subsequently start from each tone of the scale (ie. shift the pattern) we get seven different chords:</p>

<p><code>
Im
IImb5
II#5
IVm
V
VI
VIImb5
</code></p>

<p>The roman numerals indicate the root note (ie. the shift + 1). If we add also the 7th tone to the pattern we get those full and more interesting chords:</p>

<p><code>
ImM7
IIm7b5 (= VII half-dim)
IIM7#5
IVm7
V7
VIM7
VIIm6b5 (= VII dim)
</code></p>

<p>The chords in bold look a bit familiar. Im looks like Em, IVm7 looks like Am and V7 looks like B7. We can see the tonal center of the song is E and the song is based on the E harmonic minor scale. So what about the chords? Im is the tonic, the steady place, the home. V7 is the dominant which drives the passion, makes the tension and produces a feeling of returning home. IVm is the subdominant which produces weaker feeling of being on a trip. Looking at the song with those glasses we can see the harmony as follows:</p>

<p><code>
Im / V7 / V7 / Im
IVm / Im / V7 / Im
</code></p>

<p>Compared to the major scale the pitch class <code>4</code> is lowered to <code>3</code> and pitch class <code>9</code> is lowered to <code>8</code>. This corresponds to moving natural 3rd to flat 3rd and 6th to flat 6th. Regarding the chords the flat 3 in the scale is responsible for making the I chord minor and the flat 6 makes the IV chord minor.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/categories/music-theory/c-major-scale.png" alt="C major scale"></p>

<p><a href="http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/?pcs=0,2,4,5,7,9,11">C major scale</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/categories/music-theory/c-harmonic-minor-scale-vs-major.png" alt="C hamonic minor scale"></p>

<p><a href="http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/?pcs=0,2,3,5,7,8,11">C harmonic minor scale</a> (compared to the natural major scale)</p>

<p>The combination of flat 3rd <code>[3]</code> and natural 7th <code>[11]</code> produces a nice pattern <code>[11,0,2,3]</code> – half tone, whole tone, half tone – also known from the melodic minor scale. Also the one and half tone interval between the flat 6th <code>[8]</code> and 7th <code>[11]</code> sounds really good. In fact the harmonic minor scale is not only specific to latin american or spanish music since the roots are from the Middle east. But that’s another story!</p>

<p>PS: Would you like to see the tones in the pitch class circle from you own music in real-time? Check out the <a href="http://harmoneye.com/?utm_medium=blog">HarmonEye</a> desktop application.
